I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at `UC Berkeley`, focusing on the control of robotic and autonomous systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electromechanical Engineering from the `University of Macau`, where I had opportunities to delve into `robotics` and `additive manufacturing`. During my time there, I independently designed, assembled, and programmed a [3D FDM soft material printer](https://github.com/dechaojiang/Softmatter_Printer), and collaborated on designing a [library service robot](https://github.com/dechaojiang/24EME_FYP).

Before moving to the United States, I spent some time in Denmark, where I enjoyed cycling and capturing natural scenes with my camera. These are two leisure activities I am particularly passionate about.

Feel free to explore my [photography](https://dechaojiang.github.io/photography/) and [project](https://dechaojiang.github.io/projects/) archives on this page.
