## Overview
Bear Maze Escape is a third-person exploration game developed in Unity in collaboration with a friend [Qilin Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qilin-sun-3b3478253/). The player takes control of a teddy bear trapped in a maze, aiming to navigate through different themed environments and reach the exit before time or energy runs out.
