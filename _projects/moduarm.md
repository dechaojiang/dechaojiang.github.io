This project responds to the need for robotic systems that can operate in confined, obstacle-rich spaces. Traditional manipulators lack the adaptability required for such environments. To address this, we developed a modular robotic arm **optimized for reachability**, **payload capacity**, and spatial efficiency within a 1 m³ workspace. Mechanical innovation and simulation were used to evaluate how joint configuration and link length affect task adaptability.
